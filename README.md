# RDepot Kustomization

Overview:
* `base/` contains the bases
* `overlays/` contains overlays that combine and/or extend the bases. These range from minor extensions to complete example deployments. Refer to the README of each overlay for more info.

## Versions

Version-tagged images are available on docker hub.
Images tagged `:latest` are also available, but their use is discouraged.

The kustomizations in this repo are version-locked and are increased in tandem with a repository tag.
